1. What is/are the problem/s you want to solve? Why is it important?

We want to solve issues surrounding food waste and people who are in need of food. An abundance of food is thrown out everyday by many restaurants and food venues when it could be used towards helping others who are struggling to find a meal to eat. Our idea can solve these two major issues since we are utilizing what is wasted by putting it to good use. 

2. Who are the users you are targeting?

Our target users are regular, everyday people that have access to any type of vehicle or those who are willing to walk if distance permits them. Our users are those who are looking to make some money on the side through multiple food deliveries. We are also targeting users who want to make a difference in these issues surrounding food waste and helping the hungry. This can allow our users to have a strong passion in their work while they use our application to deliver food. We want our audience to be proud to use our app because not only does it benefit the users themselves, but it mainly benefits people who are less fortunate.

3. How will this app solve the tackled problem/s? Provide a vision statement.

The issue at hand is solving hunger for the homeless or less fortunate who aren't able to purchase food or have easy access to it. With our help, we make it easy for the less fortunate to gain access to food at a discounted price from restaurants. 

4. What are the major features of the app?

The app can list restaurants/food venues that are going to throw away their extra leftovers at the end of the day. The app will also provide locations to drop boxes or donation facilities to help those who want to give their clothes away to the less fortunate.  

5. What similar apps exist on the market? (at least 5 apps with names, screenshots, links,  descriptions and how different they are from what you want to do)

* [Too Good To Go](toogoodtogo.com)

Too Good To Go is an app that allows users to choose a store or restaurant and purchase “magic bags,” which contain unsold food. This helps prevent food waste by  providing a method for businesses to sell items they would otherwise throw away. This app is a good example of what we are looking to achieve, but it lacks a delivery aspect.

* [OLIO](olioex.com)

OLIO is a virtual marketplace which allows users to list and pick up unwanted food and items. Food waste is reduced by giving people a different way to get rid of things they do not want. OLIO is similar to what we are looking to achieve, but we want to provide a heavier focus on delivery.


* [Uber Eats](ubereats.com)

Uber Eats is a food ordering and delivery app that allows users to purchase food and items from participating businesses and can pick it up or have it delivered to a desired location. 

* [DoorDash](doordash.com)

DoorDash is another food ordering and delivery app, and it also allows users to purchase food and items from participating businesses for pickup or delivery. 

* [Grubhub](grubhub.com)

Grubhub is an app that allows users to purchase food for delivery or pickup from participating restaurants. It is also partnered with many college campuses to allow students to purchase food from their dining hall through the app.


6. How is your app unique?

Although there are many food service apps available, what makes our app unique is how we plan to tie the reduction of food waste with the accessibility of food delivery to benefit those who are less fortunate. We are looking to provide a more affordable feeding solution by utilizing potential food waste from restaurants and delivering it to the user for a discounted price.

7. What are the risks associated with the development of this app? Why wouldn’t it be delivered completely (scope), on time and on budget? Identify 3 to 5 risks that are relevant in your case.

There are several potential risks with developing any mobile application including 
this one, such as end-users lacking interest in the product. We believe that while 
this risk does exist, there is a distinct void in applications that attempt to combat 
food waste in terms of catering to the general population--one that we intend to
fill. With our features such as allowing for delivery and incentivizing users with
promotional content, our app could be a great success.

Another potential risk is that due to the learning curve, we may have trouble
implementing the entire scope of the application within the given time
constraints.

A potential problem that we discussed was that while users want and expect a
fully-featured application, it is possible that adding too many features may risk
cutting into the app’s development timeline and resulting in an incomplete product.

The biggest issue of concern would be getting restaurants to sign up for our
service. If we are not able to secure a substantial number of businesses to
use our app, the application would be a non-starter. However, we hope that
financial incentives will alleviate this concern.

8. What is your goal with this project? (build portfolio/resume, get experience in mobile app dev …)

As a team, each of us have different goals when it comes to this project in some
aspect. While some of us are new to app development, others have prior
experience. Some of us just want to gain experience in developing mobile apps
and gauge whether it is an industry worth pursuing, while others would like to
build their portfolio. However, we are all very passionate about this idea and
excited to see our finished product in action!
